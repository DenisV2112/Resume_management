## We desided to use git flow and a structure: 
### main: to the main production branch, representing the stable, released code. 
### develop: The integration branch where the development team makes features. 
### feature: Branches created for developing specific features.
### release: A branch created from develop to prepare for a release, addressing minor bugs and final touches before releasing. 
### hotfix: Branches created from main to address  bugs in the production code.
